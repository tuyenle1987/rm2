I demonstrate a keen understanding of writing industry-standard code, ensuring required code test coverage that includes unit tests, functional tests, and integration tests. I've showcased their software development cycle expertise by actively participating in on-call duties and software deployment practices, leveraging CD/CI tools like BuildKite and Terraform. Additionally, I have expressed proficiency in software observability, gaining hands-on experience with tools such as DataDog and Amplitude.
